# guides

This repo has two things:

1. A list of great places (mostly food) in cities that I have lived in
2. A list of great resources that I have used to deeply understand various subjects

Many of the resources (and a few of the food places) are no longer there, so be warned. But in the small chance that this helps somebody out there, it's now online!
